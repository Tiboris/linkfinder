Posted: Mon Apr 08, 2002 11:47 pm	Post subject: Welcome to gentoo.frozenliquid.net
  





This forum is my shot at helping users of Gentoo (including myself  ).  Right now the forums are pretty basic.  Soon as we see if the site takes off or dies maybe we could move it to something more appropriate such as forums.gentoo.org, and add more forums.  Right now I am  only powered by a 2000/380 on cable.  Not that great, but MRTG tells me that I rarely ever hit my cap.  So I guess we'll see...&#13;


In the mean time, we have to get people to spread the word and use the forum.  I usually hang out on IRC @ irc.openprojects.net in #gentoo as nitroteen.  You can reach me there, or drop me an email @ kyle@frozenliquid.net&#13;


After we get more users we can create new forums, add some moderators.&#13;


Now that you are here, go make an account and test it out, and most importantly, spread the word! [/url]_________________- Kyle Manna&#13;

It seems like a pretty good idea. i really like the forum theme, and best of all i didn't have to rummage through my email to find some assigned password, like on other boards 


lookn' good, good luck

Cool forum, i realy like phpbb2, I've got it running here too 


But isn't it a thing to make the polls open for not-registered users ? That way every 1 could vote, and get a lot more votes..._________________Woei.

I don't know if that would be such a good idea, with requring a login we can prevent people from voting a million times.  Of course that doesn't stop someone from making another account and voting again, but I guess it helps.&#13;


If more people want it, I guess I could fix it._________________- Kyle Manna&#13;

I run 2 forums here at home as well on a 3.5Meg / 1.2Meg DSL, and MRTG shows me that I never use it all!  1 forum is pretty big, and the other is private.. so no worries. This may eventually... I mean eventually have to go to a professional hosting company, or get Gentoo to make this official 


I like the idea.. Keep it up.&#13;

a good voting system (which I'm sure phpbb has) will only allow one vote per ip... so making it anonymous should be fine (and allow for more a bigger surveyed audience)

What about those guys?  I like the URL, but I like the look/feel of this site better.&#13;


Is there some kind of agreement you guys can come to perhaps?&#13;


forums.gentoo.org sounds nice too.&#13;


I feel bad for gentoouser.org guys because that's a perfectly fitting domain going to waste._________________-- &#13;

The forum is an excelent idea.&#13;


Currently it seems the only way to get help is through the mailing list. The problem with that is there is no search facility that I could find so help requests end up being repeated over and over.&#13;


I hope this takes off. Gentoo is excelent, but I've certainly had more problems with it than any other distro a good help forum is needed._________________/* Halley */&#13;

horrible idea - 2 forums that basically do the same?&#13;


Why not make forums.gentoo.org even better instead?

underwhich domain name? Ask him?  Otherwise, I'm guessing the thread title hints at what domain name._________________lolgov. 'cause where we're going, you don't have civil liberties.&#13;
